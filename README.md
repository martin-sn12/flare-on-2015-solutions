# FLARE-ON 2015 challenge - beat it with this code
For the challenges 4, 6, 9 and 10, I had to write some code in order to find the flag.

Challenge 2 is a very simple xor encryption.

Challenge 4 is a simple OllyDbg script which automates what you would otherwise have to do by hand.

Challenge 6 is a prime-based challenge. Just multiplication and division really, fairly easy.

Challenge 9 was heavily obfuscated, but it was nothing you can't beat by tracing instructions and/or writing IDAPython scripts to deobfuscate it. The file contains the clean algorithm and outputs the correct flag.

Challenge 10 is about the same as challenge 9, it's self-explanatory.
